# Pressure Drop Prediction

## Overview

Accurately predicting pressure drops in fluid systems is critical for designing and optimizing various engineering applications. Traditional methods often face limitations when dealing with complex non-Newtonian fluids. This project explores the potential of machine learning techniques to improve prediction accuracy in such cases.

## Features

- **Data-Driven Approach**: Utilizes experimental data to train machine learning models for pressure drop prediction.
- **Algorithm Performance Evaluation**: Compares the effectiveness of various machine learning algorithms in this context.
- **Non-Newtonian Fluid Focus**: Addresses the specific challenges in predicting pressure drops in non-Newtonian fluids.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains datasets used for training and testing the models.
- `models/`: Includes trained machine learning models and related scripts.
- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists Python dependencies required for the project.
